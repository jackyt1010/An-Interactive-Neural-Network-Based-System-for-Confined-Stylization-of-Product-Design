A localized NeuralStyleTransfer for Fashionable Product based on VGG-19
======================

Neural Style Transfer is a task of transferring style
of one image to another. It does it by using features of some pretrained model.
In this project, the employed model was used for localized stylization of specific shape
of the product image.
